## Problem 1
- Scenario: Stadium
- Assumptions:
  - explain_your_assumptions
- Assets:
  1. The lawn. It should be well cared for and maintained.
  2. Floodlights. 
  3. The seats.
  4. Bathroom, parking lot and locker room.
  5. Spectators’ properties and life
  6. Football players’ properties and life.

- Threats:
  1. The terrorists. They may bring life-threatening bombs and try to kill a lot of people.
  2. Football Hooliganism. Fans from the home and visitor team can get into severe violent behaviors.
  3. Thieves. They may steal valuable properties from the spectators or even from the sports team members. They can steal at the parking      lot, at the spectator area and at the locker room and the bathroom.
  4. Some people may want to do harm to the lawn or the lights in order to stop the home football team from training. Because the            football team is ranked the best in the country, there is a great chance that fans from the other football team want to do whatever      they can to let their team win. (availability)
  5. The rivals may want to steal the strategies of the football team in order to gain advantages. (confidentiality)

- Countermeasures:
  1. Check the status of the lawn, the lights, the seats, the bathroom and maintain them periodically. Make sure that they are in great      status.
  2. Set different exits for fans of different teams. Ban identified hooligans from the stadium.
  3. Separate fans and let them sit in different areas. Build fences to protect them from each other.
  4. Screen anyone who enters the stadium, make sure there are not dangerous items like bombs in the stadium.
  5. Build fences around the stadium and hire people to guard the stadium. This method is very important and has to be done first. When any accidents happen, these guards and policeman can act immediately. Also, they can keep the thieves away.
  6. Plan for the emergency exit. Place signatures that point to the nearest exit at the stadium, this can keep the stadium away from        human-crush.


## Problem 2
- Scenario: Grading
- Assumptions:
  - explain_your_assumptions
- Assets:
  1. The contents of the homework of every student.
  2. The Student ID, Email, phone number, submission date, IP of the student’s network, submitting date of the homework.                      (confidentiality and integrity and privacy)
  3. My user ID, account password, security questions and answers, phone number, IP of my network, the grads I gave, (confidentiality        and integrity and privacy)
  4. The availability of the grading website. Students should be able to submit at any time and I should be able to grade at any time.        (availability)
  5. The authenticity of the members. Students can only submit but they cannot grade. I should be the only one who can grade the              homework. (authenticity)

- Threats:
  1. The attacker may what to eavesdrop or modify the contents of the homework. If the attacker is one of the students, he can either        modify his own homework for a higher grade or modify other students’ homework for them getting lower grades.
  2. The attacker may want to get personal information from the students and me. For example, if he gets the IP of a person, he could        locate the network which probably shows the address of the student’s house or apartment.
  3. The attacker may want to modify the grades, the submitting date, my account password, my security questions, and answers. For            example, if a student turns in the homework late, he probably would attack the website to modify the submitting date earlier.
  4. The attacker may want to hack the website to bring it offline. This way nobody can turn in the homework and I cannot grade their        homework in time but struggle to bring the website online. This might buy the attacker some time for their homework.
  5. The attacker may want to modify the authenticity and give themselves the power of grading homework.

- Countermeasures:
  1. Ask the students not to include their student ID and important private information in their homework. This method costs nothing          but can prevent some private information from being leaked.
  2. Has some PRF-like function to encode the ID, Email, phone number, password when students send homework through the network.  This        method also costs little but can prevent some private information from being leaked and modified.
  3. Got a better firewall and antivirus program running on my computer (the server), and at the same time, ask students to have a            better firewall and antivirus program installed too. This way costs some money to buy those programs but it is still economical.
  4. I should be careful about using portable storage devices. One fact is that a lot of computer virus propagate through portable            storage devices. So, when I am using one, I should consider the risks of getting my computer infected by the virus. The                  countermeasure might be not using portable storage devices, but this causes inconvenience when the resource is unavailable from the      internet.
  5. Set creative password. Don’t use passwords based on my birthday, name, spouse, etc. Those passwords are easy to be cracked. If my        computer gets stolen or someone wants to login into my account, a creative password would stop them from accessing my computer and      account. This method is really efficient and it costs you nearly nothing.
  6. Stop using the computer and ask students to turn in their paper-based homework. This method is the strongest, it almost stops any        kind of attacks from the internet. But the disadvantages are obvious: I should grade the homework on the paper and that is              inconvenient, especially when the homework is a project which has a lot of programs.


## Problem 3
- Scenario: As a graduate student, the common scenarios are that I study at the library until very late in the night. How do I go back   to my apartment safely?
- Assumptions:
  - explain_your_assumptions
- Assets:
  1. My laptop, which I will always carry with me. It contains all my homework and projects.
  2. My mobile phone, it contains important private information, for example, pictures, bank account, social media, etc.
  3. My life. I need to stay away from any kinds of criminals and be safe
  4. My wallet and everything in it. All the cards, the keys, the passport, cash, etc.
  5. My clothes. Even though I think nobody would want to rub my clothes. But just in case, I will write it here.  

- Threats:
  1. Bad people may steal my laptop, my mobile phone, and my wallet.
  2. Some criminals may rob me of my laptop, my mobile phone, my wallet, and even my clothes.
  3. If they steal or rob me of my laptop or mobile phone, they may have access to important private information like bank account,          apartment address, ID number, etc. They can even scam my friends once they have access to my contact list. Also, because I lost my      laptop, I lost my homework, projects, and all the studying materials.
  4. If they steal or rob me of my wallet. I lost all my cards and identifications. They may use my credit or debit card to buy things        before I report to the bank about the missing cards, which could be a major financial loss.
  5. I might get hurt by those criminals. If I get stabbed, it would a serious life-threatening matter.
.
- Countermeasures:
  1. The first thing I can do is to stay away from criminals. Instead of taking the metro to go home, I could call for uber to take me        home. But it could be expensive and I cannot afford to take a uber every day.
  2. The second way could be buying a car myself. But I just come to America for only a week. I have to get a driver license first and        then purchase a car. Things could be complicated and I don’t know if I have enough time to do it now.
  3. Ask for late night escort from RUPD. This is a possible solution, but I heard that they can only escort me to the metro station.        The rest of the journey is still dangerous.
  4. Go back home together with my friends. The thing is that I don’t have a friend who also lives in my neighborhood right now.
  5. Set special passwords for entering my computer and mobile phone. And have some backup of the projects, homework, and materials at        home. Moreover, I can have an app that can destroy the information on my phone when I lost it. This could help me protect my            private information and I can still turn in the homework if I lost my computer.
  6. Don’t place all the cards in the wallet and don’t take too much money with me. However, bring some cash would be necessary, you can      give it to the criminals so that they won’t hurt you. This could save my life!
  7. Don’t take the metro at a fixed time. There is a chance that the criminals will take the metro at the fixed time same as me. I          don’t want to bump into them and get rubbed again!
  8. Exercise regularly. Normally, If I have a strong body, there is less chance of being rubbed. What’s more, having a strong body          means you can run faster and get away from criminals. (Hopefully)
  9. When waiting for the metro, stand at the places where the cameras can see. Even if I get rubbed, the police can identify the            criminal through the camera and get my things back.
